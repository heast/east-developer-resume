        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I am a classically trained musician turned software developer. After teaching music for three years and 
            experiencing burnout, I taught myself how to code. I realized I still needed some formal training, so I 
            started a second bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. I now work full time as a developer while taking 
            one class at a time. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am interested in transitioning into a new full-time position in the South Carolina Upstate or a remote 
            position (occasional travel not a problem).

        <span class="oneunit right-align">BJU Inc. October 2017 - present</span>
    </div>
    <p>
        WMS (Warehouse Management System) is used by the BJU Press Distribution Center to manage warehouse inventory 
        and fulfill orders imported from the customer-facing eCommerce site. WMS replaces legacy 4GL code and its 
        Informix database with an updated web-based application.
    </p>


    <div>
        <h4>Python/Django</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Implemented the WMS fulfillment module, which contains classes for each step in the order processing 
                procedure. An average of more than 6,100 orders per month (over the past 16 months) were processed, 
                with individual shipping weights ranging from a few ounces to more than 33,900lbs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Designed and implemented a service that decides how boxes should be packed given the items in an order, 
                whether certain items need to stay together as much as possible, the locations of the items in the 
                warehouse, and the various boxes available near those locations. An average of more than 15,500 boxes 
                were packed and shipped per month (over the past 16 months).
            </li>
            <li>
                Designed and implemented a testing tool to allow users and stakeholders to interact directly with the 
                box plan service. Users could create custom scenarios, submit feedback, and view current and previous 
                results side by side as improvements were made. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Designed and implemented a class that analyzes and groups items for producing an XML structure used to 
                create each order’s packing slip. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Designed and implemented a process to record pick-up and campus delivery orders.
            </li>
            <li>
                Designed and implemented a process by which users may re-arrange box contents within a given order after 
                the box has been filled.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ongoing:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Implement RESTful endpoints to accept, parse, and return JSON as WMS needs to communicate with 
                        third-party software. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Design Django ORM queries ranging from simple object fetches to complex queries requiring 
                        annotation, OuterRef/Subquery expressions, Case expressions, Prefetch objects, and complex Q 
                        objects. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Solve problems and implement solutions for bug tickets assigned to me.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make use of advanced Python features such as designing and implementing generator functions and 
                        function decorators.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implement and maintain test classes inheriting from Django’s TestCase, using Unittest features 
                        like fixtures, patching, and subTests. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Occasionally implement front-end pages using Django’s template language, Bootstrap, jQuery, and 
                        some customized CSS classes.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>SQL Server:</h4>
        <p>
            Write SQL queries for finding hidden problems in the data, debug Django-constructed queries, and perform 
            occasional critical record updates on the production server when instructed to do so.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Unix:</h4>
        <p>
            Analyze logs using CentOS text processing tools, perform occasional troubleshooting, and automate various 
            tasks by writing Python and Bash scripts.
        </p>

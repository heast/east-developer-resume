## README

The purpose of this project is to host my resume in the cloud as a small demo to potential employers. 

Goals:
* (WIP) Create a static web page of my resume.
* Deploy as an Amazon S3 static website. 
* Enable SSL.
* Implement a visitor counter, storing the count in DynamoDB.
* Implement an API to communicate between the client and the database.
* Add unit tests for the aforementioned API.
* Set up CI/CD using GitHub Actions.

Thanks to @forrestbrazeal for the idea. I discovered the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://forrestbrazeal.com/2020/04/23/the-cloud-resume-challenge/)
too late for the actual challenge, but it's a great project.
